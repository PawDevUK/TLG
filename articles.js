                    "Refactored JumboCard state into a small React Context (app/hooks/jumboCardContext.tsx) exposing isOpen, activeRoute, open, close and toggle. Wrapped the app in <JumboCardProvider> in app/layout.tsx so Header and Footer can access shared state. Header now uses useJumboCard() to open/toggle the JumboCard and no longer keeps local jumbo state.\n\nMade the JumboCard a client component and implemented a robust click-outside handler (pointerdown) that calls context.close() when the user clicks outside the JumboCard area — this centralises close behaviour inside the overlay itself. The overlay still exposes the close (X) button for explicit dismissal.\n\nSimplified the GreenButton API: removed the previous close handler forwarding so links and buttons are pure navigation/actions (preserving middle-click/new-tab behaviour). Footer and Header no longer programmatically close the JumboCard; closing is handled by the JumboCard component. Fixed related prop typings and lint issues.\n\nNormalized header login links to '/login' (lowercase) to avoid case-sensitivity 404s on Vercel. Verified local dev: opening JumboCard via header toggles overlay, clicking outside closes it, and navigation links work as expected.",

                    "Enhanced FitnessApp landing page and navigation structure. Fixed routing issues by moving Navbar inside Router component to enable proper Link functionality. Converted Bootstrap carousel to React Bootstrap Carousel component for proper JavaScript functionality with Bootstrap 4. Added all 14 fitness images from FitnessApp/img directory to carousel with automatic slide transitions, controls, and indicators disabled for slides-only display mode. Updated navbar background color to #E67E22 (vibrant orange). Restructured FitnessApp layout to achieve full-screen width for both navbar and carousel by removing container restrictions and wrapping only inner content. Converted styled-components (Wrapper, MainWrapper, RightWrapper, LeftWrapper) to standard div elements in FitnessApp.jsx for cleaner code structure. Created comprehensive LandingPage/Carousel.jsx component with proper React Bootstrap integration including 14 Carousel.Item components with descriptive alt text. Modified navbar-component.jsx removing wrapper div and applying inline backgroundColor style. Updated Directory.md to reflect complete project structure including FitnessApp with api/, components/, and img/ directories, Register_Login, Work_Tracker, TimeLine components, and all missing configuration files, fonts, and image directories (excluding node_modules as requested). Made 15+ commits, modified 4 files. Successfully resolved Bootstrap JavaScript dependency issues, implemented fully functional carousel with automatic transitions, and achieved responsive full-width layout for enhanced UX.",

Refactored BASE_URL in fitnessApi.js to conditionally use SERVER_URL for production and localhost:8080 for local development based on window.location.hostname. Addressed CORS policy issues between frontend (pawelsiwek.co.uk) and backend by documenting need for Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers and preflight request handling. Updated vercel.json build configuration with NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider flag to resolve OpenSSL compatibility issues with Node.js 17+. Removed unused imports (ubuntu, python) from stack.config.js and createSelector from particlesOptions.selector.js to eliminate build warnings.

Implemented html2canvas configuration with scale: 2 for quality, useCORS: true for cross-origin images, ignoreElements callback to exclude .no-pdf class elements, and onclone callback to inject download-specific CSS classes into cloned document. Addressed PDF page break problem where \"Junior Full-Stack Developer – Filament AI\" section was cut in half between pages by creating cv-h5-for-Donload CSS class with margin-top: 120px to push \"Portfolio Frontend\" section to new page, specifically targeting it via textContent check in onclone callback. Enhanced cv.css with comma selector pattern for shared properties across cv-h5, cv-h5-nonMargin-top, and cv-h5-for-Donload classes, allowing property inheritance with selective overrides. Restructured CV page header using CSS Grid (grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr) with ButtonWrapper using flexbox (justify-content: flex-end, align-items: start) for right-aligned download button.
