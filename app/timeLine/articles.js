Added document-level pointerdown event listener in useEffect for global click tracking. Implemented el.contains(target) check to determine clicks inside/outside component. Added special exception for navigation buttons using target.closest('nav button') and target.closest('nav a') to prevent menu closure when clicking nav items. Proper cleanup with removeEventListener to prevent memory leaks. Fixed API route display issue - removed hardcoded placeholder to show actual API data. Updated articles.json with comprehensive project history from git logs covering all work from June 24 to November 22."

Converted Bootstrap carousel to React Bootstrap Carousel component for proper JavaScript functionality with Bootstrap 4. Added all 14 fitness images from FitnessApp/img directory to carousel with automatic slide transitions, controls, and indicators disabled for slides-only display mode. Updated navbar background color to #E67E22 (vibrant orange). Restructured FitnessApp layout to achieve full-screen width for both navbar and carousel by removing container restrictions and wrapping only inner content. Converted styled-components (Wrapper, MainWrapper, RightWrapper, LeftWrapper) to standard div elements in FitnessApp.jsx for cleaner code structure. Created comprehensive LandingPage/Carousel.jsx component with proper React Bootstrap integration including 14 Carousel.Item components with descriptive alt text. Modified navbar-component.jsx removing wrapper div and applying inline backgroundColor style. Updated Directory.md to reflect complete project structure including FitnessApp with api/, components/, and img/ directories, Register_Login, Work_Tracker, TimeLine components, and all missing configuration files, fonts, and image directories (excluding node_modules as requested). Made 15+ commits, modified 4 files.
